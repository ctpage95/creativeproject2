<p>One quote I particularly liked was "...if man can take the ruins, rubble, and remains of a broken city and rebuild an awe-inspiring structure that rises toward the heavens, how much more capable is our Almighty Father to restore His children who have fallen, struggled, or become lost?"
I am grateful for a merciful and loving Heavenly Father that despite my shortcomings, He is always there to "rebuild" me into something stronger. I am also grateful for the trials that He allows me to go through that also help me grow, progress, and learn to rely on Him. I know that, regardless of how obedient I am, my trials will never go away, but as long as I continue to do the "small and simple things", I can have peace and find JOY through the hard times as I have faith in the larger picture.</p>
