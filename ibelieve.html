<p>From Elder Holland's talk, what especially stuck out to me was his testimony of Joseph Smith. He said, "... I also know that in doing so- particularly through translating the Book of Mormon- [Joseph Smith] has taught me more of God's love, of Christ's divinity, and of priesthood power than any other prophet of whom I have ever read, known, or heard in a lifetime of seeking."
I promise that Mormon's do not worship Joseph Smith. However, we are grateful for his dedication in being the instrument the Lord could use to lay the foundation of CHRIST's church, NOT Joseph Smith's church. I know so much because of him.</p>
