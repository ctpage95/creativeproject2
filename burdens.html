<p>From Elder Bednar's talk, what mostly stuck out to me was him speaking of the Atonement. He said, "Thus, the Savior has suffered not just for our sins and iniquities-but also for our physical pains and anguish, our weaknesses and shortcomings, our fears and frustrations, our disappointments and discouragement, our regrets and remorse, our despair and desperation, the injustices we experience, and the emotional distresses that beset us."
I am grateful for the knowledge I have that I am not perfect, but through Christ, I can be a little better each day and that He will be with me through my trials and shortcomings.</p>
